- I'm not sure why Marimo doesn't work as expected:
  - I think I needed install both marimo and marimo[sql]
  - It needs its dependencies clearly installed
  - It doesn't run SQL queries
  - It doesn't run AI thingies
  - Its VS Code doesn't work
- This should be figured out so that I can easily use it afresh every time
- Ideally, I'd just install marimo, play around with it and only then use
  the dependencies in the whole repo
- I should also set up Makefile based on this later
- OR! I could just set up marimo right once and that is in _playground
  and then only create a new dir when I know this is to be more complex
